This project is intended to contain the code for the node editor itself, excluding the Regex-specific logic for nodexr.

This is currently a work-in-progress, and only contains the code that could most easily be extracted from nodexr.
The long-term goal is to turn this project into a package that could be reused by other similar projects.
